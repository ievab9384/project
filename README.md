Description: Welcome to the Sanrio Characters Quiz project! 
This interactive quiz aims to test users' knowledge about various Sanrio characters, such as Hello Kitty, My Melody, Chococat, and more. Users can answer a series of questions related to Sanrio characters and receive immediate feedback whether their answers were correct or not. I chose to create such a project since I recently finished my bachelors degree in Asian studies, specifically Japanese, and wanted to combine my newly acquired programming knowledge with Japanese modern culture for this project. 

Technologies used:
1.HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used for structuring the content of the web page, including quiz questions and interactive elements.

2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Applied for styling and formatting, enhancing the visual presentation of the quiz page.

3.JavaScript (JS): Employed for handling the quiz logic, dynamically generating quiz elements, evaluating user responses, and providing immediate feedback.

4.GitHub Codespaces: Utilized for the development environment, enabling me to work on my project in an online, cloud-based environment.

4.Git: Used for version control, tracking changes to my project and facilitating collaboration.

5.Markdown: Used for writing the README file in a structured and readable format.

Project Structure
1. index.html
The index.html file serves as the main entry point for the Sanrio Characters Quiz. It includes the HTML structure for the quiz page, such as the title, header, quiz container, character images, explanations container, and the "Go Back" button.
The page is divided into sections, each playing a specific role in the overall functionality and presentation.

2. styles.css
The styles.css file contains the CSS styles used to enhance the visual presentation of the quiz. It defines the layout, colors, and positioning of elements on the page, ensuring a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience.
The CSS rules define the appearance of the characters, quiz container, and other elements.

3. scripts.js
The scripts.js file includes JavaScript code responsible for handling the quiz logic. It dynamically generates quiz elements, evaluates user responses, and provides immediate feedback. The script also manages the display of explanations after the quiz is completed.

4. quiz.js
The quiz.js file contains an array of quiz data objects, each representing a question along with its options and the correct answer. This data is used by the JavaScript code to dynamically generate the quiz elements on the page. It serves as the backbone of my quiz, providing the content for users to interact with.

5. images directory
The images directory stores image assets for Sanrio characters, such as Hello Kitty, Chococat and My Melody. These images enhance the visual appeal of the quiz by providing a recognizable representation of each character.



Design Choices
Theme and Aesthetic:
The design of the Sanrio Characters Quiz is inspired by the charming and endearing world of Sanrio characters. By incorporating pastel colors and featuring iconic characters such as Hello Kitty, My Melody, and Chococat, the quiz aims to create an atmosphere that resonates with the Japanese concept of "Kawaii" or cuteness. This aesthetic choice is intentional, targeting audiences who appreciate the whimsical and adorable aspects of Japanese pop culture.

Pastel Colors:
The use of pastel colors throughout the website contributes to a soft and visually pleasing palette. Pastels are known for their calming and friendly effect, making the quiz more inviting to users. The gentle hues also align with the overall theme of Sanrio characters, as these characters are often associated with a sweet and innocent charm.

Recognizable Character Images:
Incorporating images of well-known Sanrio characters serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it adds a playful and delightful visual element to the quiz, making the experience enjoyable for users. Secondly, the use of recognizable characters aids in immediate identification and engagement, especially for individuals familiar with Sanrio's extensive character lineup.

Accessibility and Inclusivity:
The choice of a simple and clean layout, coupled with easily distinguishable color schemes, contributes to the accessibility of the quiz. The design ensures that users of all ages, including kids who might be drawn to the adorable characters, can easily navigate and participate in the quiz. This inclusivity aligns with the universal appeal of Sanrio characters.

Cultural Connection:
As someone with a background in Asian studies, particularly Japanese culture, the design reflects a thoughtful connection to the cultural significance of Sanrio characters. The incorporation of these characters into a quiz format allows for an interactive exploration of Japanese pop culture, making the project a blend of entertainment and cultural appreciation.

Educational Component:
Beyond entertainment, the inclusion of detailed explanations for each question adds an educational layer to the quiz. Users not only test their knowledge but also gain insights into the background of Sanrio characters. This design choice transforms the quiz into an informative experience for users interested in learning more about the characters they love.

Responsiveness:
The project has been designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. The use of flexible layouts and media queries in the CSS file facilitates a user-friendly interface on both desktop and mobile devices.

Immediate Feedback:
The JavaScript code provides immediate feedback to users after each quiz question, highlighting correct and incorrect answers. This feature aims to enhance user engagement and learning.

Explanations:
Upon completing the quiz, users receive detailed explanations for each question. This educational component offers additional insights into Sanrio characters, making the quiz not only entertaining but also informative.

Possible Improvements:

User Interface Enhancements
Could improve the overall layout and styling to enhance the visual appeal of the quiz.
By implementing animations or transitions, it would be possible to create a more engaging user experience.

Mobile Optimization:
Further optimizing my website for mobile devices would provide a seamless experience on smaller screens.
By testing and adjusting the layout, it would ensure readability and usability on different mobile devices.

Dynamic Content:
Expanding the quiz with more questions and diverse content would increase the variety of questions users encounter.
It could also be achieved by adding different types of quiz questions, such as multiple-choice, true/false, or image-based questions.


Leaderboard or Scoring System:
Implementing a scoring system or leaderboard to track and display users' quiz scores, would make the website more interactive and complex.


Feedback Mechanism:
By including a feedback mechanism it would be possible for users to provide comments or suggestions about the quiz.
I could use this feedback to make continuous improvements to the quiz content and user experience.

Localization:
By providing support for multiple languages it would be possible to cater to a broader audience.
Allowing users to choose their preferred language for the quiz could be one way to achieve this.

Testing:
By regularly testing my website on different browsers and devices could make it easier to identify and address any compatibility issues.
